# [Daily Myths](http://dailymyths.org/)

This project was built in 24 hours during the [International Space Apps Challenge](http://spaceappschallenge.org/) on 21-22 April 2012 in San Francisco. **It won the Award for Education outreach!**

The idea for it came out of the Challenge called: [Visualize the "All-too-Common Astronomy/Solar System Misconceptions](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/visualize-all-too-common-astronomysolar-system-mis/). 

We thought the title was really long so we decided to rebrand it: Daily Myths [dailymyths.org](http://dailymyths.org)

This Trivia is our approach to make people learn while having fun and to make those Misconceptions go away.

## You can help!

**If you happen to speak a language in which Daily Myths is not yet available** (currently available in: english, german and chinese) then it would be absolutely brilliant if you could add translations! It's easy! Just have a look into our [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar3qBZOJQ4WBdDk3ajRQTzdKdGNTZnptR3lNYWZkMlE). It contains all the data that powers the app. If you run into issues or have questions simply file an [issue in our tracker](https://github.com/ginader/Misconceptions/issues)

**If you stumble over a common Myth that people still believe and you feel like you have to change that** then go ahead and add it! We always want people to become more educated :-)

## The Translations
The Questions and Answers and all of their Translations live in our [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar3qBZOJQ4WBdDk3ajRQTzdKdGNTZnptR3lNYWZkMlE). To visibly show the state of the different Translations we have a color code:

* A Text that is missing or outdated in a language is marked with a red background color in the respective column
* A Question that needs rework is marked pink in the whole row
* Any new Myth (row) is marked in green.
* Any row that is fine as it is is just plain white
* New Myths need to be added in english as common denominator so it can be translated
